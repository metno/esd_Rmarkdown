## Rapid Winter Flooding (melting ice, narrow mountain streams, flooding) around Dresden, Germany

Dresden is the largest city in the Eastern part of Germany, Saxony, near the Czech border. It is crossed by the large river Elbe (its width is around 110m in Dresden) which comes from the Czech Republic and flows through Magdeburg and Hamburg into the North Sea. The region between Dresden and the Czech border, but also in the near surroundings in the Eastern and South-Western directions, is quite hilly with mountains up to ca. 1200 m. In the recent past (especially notable are the big floodings in 2002 and 2013) there has been quite some floodings caused by intense and long rain which led to floods of the Elbe.However, there is another threat which is happening more often and hence causing more damage because of the currently ongoing climate changes. In the mountains are lots of small mountain streams which are really small on a normal day (a typical one has a width of 1.5m and a depth of 0.5m). But in cases of heavy rains these small streams rapidly grow quite large (1-2h is not uncommon), especially compared to their normal size (sometimes they grow to their hundredfold size in respect of the amount of water they carry). This causes a lot of damage, especially as prediction and short-term prevention mechanisms are not really possible because of the small timescale. The damages caused by such events are quite local and often not related to the flooding of big rivers. In these  regions there are often roads going through valley which are vital in a sense that if they are  not available any more, quite long bypasses have to be taken. Additionally railways,  especially railway bridges, are often effected as well. These two aspects show the impacts on the transport network.

Data from ECA&D: precipitation. Snow depth?

```{r}
library(esd)
ss <- select.station(param='precip',cntr='Germany',alt=250,nmin=75)
map(ss,new=FALSE)
Y <- station(ss)
Y <- subset(Y,it=c(1950,2015))
diagnose(Y)
nv <- apply(coredata(Y),2,'nv')
Y <- subset(Y,is=nv > 24000)
```


```{r}
y <- subset(Y,is=1)
coredata(y) <- rowMeans(coredata(Y))
attr(y,'location') <- 'German higher elevation'
attr(y,'longitude') <- mean(lon(Y))
attr(y,'latitude') <- mean(lat(Y))
attr(y,'altitude') <- min(alt(Y))
plot(y)
lines(trend(y),lty=2)
grid()
```


Area total precipitation from gridded EOBS.

```{r}
rr <- retrieve('data.ECAD/rr_0.25deg_reg.nc',lon=range(lon(Y)),lat=range(lat(Y)))
map(rr,new=FALSE)
Arr <- aggregate.area(rr)
plot(rr,new=FALSE)
```

Wet day mean and frequency

```{r}
mu <- annual(rr,FUN='wetmean')
fw <- annual(rr,FUN='wetfreq')
MU <- aggregate.area(mu,FUN='mean')
FW <- aggregate.area(fw,FUN='mean')
plot(MU,new=FALSE)
lines(trend(MU),lty=2)
grid()
plot(FW,new=FALSE)
grid()
lines(trend(FW),lty=2)
```

Plot the probability of more than 50mm/day

```{r}
Pr.50 <- FW*exp(-50/MU)
plot(Pr.50)
lines(trend(Pr.50),lty=2)
grid()
```

Test to see if the long-wave outgoing radiation (OLR) can be used as a predictor for the winter-time wet-day mean precipitation over Germany. It contains information about cloud tops, and the hypothesis is that heavy precipitation comes from clouds with high (and cold) cloud tops.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
olr <- retrieve('~/Downloads/ERAINT-OLR-mon.nc', lon=c(-50,40),lat=c(40,70))
olr <- subset(as.4seasons(olr),it='djf')
eof.olr<- EOF(olr,n=5)
class(eof.olr)[3] <- "season"
mu.djf <- subset(as.4seasons(Y,FUN='wetmean'),it='djf')
pca.mu <- PCA(pcafill(mu.djf),n=5)
ds.mu.orl <- DS(pca.mu,eof.olr)
plot(ds.mu.orl,new=FALSE)
```

The calibration is fairly successful in identifying a connection between OLR and precipitation intencity. To see if other factors such as moisture has an effect, we estimate the residual from this regression analysis and repeat the analysis using saturation water vapour as predictor. This way, we avoid correlation/overlap between the two factors.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
## Estimate the residuals
pca.res <- subset(pca.mu,it=ds.mu.orl)
coredata(pca.res) <- coredata(pca.res) - coredata(ds.mu.orl)
plot(pca.res)
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
mat <- retrieve('~/Downloads/ERAINT-t2m-mon.nc', lon=c(-90,40),lat=c(30,70))
es <- C.C.eq(mat)
es <- subset(as.4seasons(es),it='djf')
es <- mask(es,land=TRUE)
eof.es<- EOF(es,n=10)
class(eof.es)[3] <- "season"
ds.mu.es <- DS(pca.res,eof.es)
plot(ds.mu.es,new=FALSE)
```

A projection of future wet-day mean precipitation based on DSensemble will be carried out in two steps. First use the PCA from the original data as predictands in a set of runs with OLR as predictors. Then use the residual as estimated above as predictand for a set of DSensembles runs with the water vapour pressure as predictors. The final result is the sum of these two steps.The wet-day mean precipitation is projected through s single stemp where DSensemble uses SLP as predictor. The seasonal means are then estimated as the product between the wet-day frequency and the wet-day mean precipitation.


## Projections

Need to read the predictors again to get all months

```{r}
T2M <- retrieve('~/Downloads/ERAINT-t2m-mon.nc', lon=c(-90,40),lat=c(30,70))
OLR <- retrieve('~/Downloads/ERAINT-OLR-mon.nc', lon=c(-50,40),lat=c(40,70))
## Also - fix the index of eof - set to year.
index(eof.dry) <- year(eof.dry)
```


Two seperate analyses based on OLR and saturation vapour pressure respectively, assuming the RCP 4.5 emission scenario. The first iteration uses the original predictand whereas the latter uses the residuals.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
if (!file.exists('dse.mu.olr.rda')) {
  dse.mu.olr <- DSensemble.eof(pca.mu,predictor=OLR,it='djf',path="~/data/CMIP5.monthly",pattern = "rlut_Amon_ens_")
  save(dse.mu.olr,file = 'dse.mu.olr.rda')
} else load('dse.mu.olr.rda')
plot(dse.mu.olr)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
if (!file.exists('dse.mu.es.rda')) {
  dse.mu.es <- DSensemble.eof(pca.res,predictor=SLP,it='djf',path="~/data/CMIP5.monthly",pattern = "tas_Amon_ens_")
  save(dse.mu.es,file = 'dse.mu.es.rda')
} else load('dse.mu.es.rda')
plot(dse.mld.slp)
```

Need to add the two together.

## Analysis: temperature

Check for melting.

```{r}
ss <- select.station(param='tn',cntr='Germany',alt=500,nmin=75)
map(ss)
X <- subset(station(ss),it=month.abb[1:4])
diagnose(X)
X <- subset(X,it=c(1940,2015))
```

```{r}
tnx <- annual(X,FUN='max',nmin=100)
plot(tnx,new=FALSE)
grid()
```
